## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been enjoying working on an indie game as a game dev.
I'm using the open source engine, godot, to create a top-down, bullet hell, that shows off a fun story about a little boy trying to find his mom.

I'm currently on the look out for a role in backend development, ideally writing Go, Python, or C#.
I love to work with a fast paced team, who are flexible and dedicated to their product.
